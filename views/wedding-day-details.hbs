            <p class="first-p"><strong>By Car</strong></p>

            <p>You are advised to enter Richmond Park via the Richmond Gate entrance. Turn right at the roundabout
                and follow the road until you reach the free car park on the right.</p>

            <p><strong>By Train/Tube</strong></p>

            <p>The venue is a short taxi ride away from Richmond Station with a taxi rank located
                outside the station. <a href="/itinerary#taxi">Find recommended taxi companies in the area</a></p>
            <p>Alternatively, the closest bus stop is outside the American University -
                371 bus from Richmond Town Centre or Kingston. The Lodge is then a 20 minute walk
                through the Park.</p>

            <h4>Car Parking</h4>
            <p>Guests who are driving should leave extra time to get parked - perhaps <strong class="text-lowercase">an hour</strong>
                before ceremony as the car park can get extremely busy and is also open to the general public.</p>

            <h4>Evening Guest Parking</h4>
            <p>All gates to Richmond Park will be closed at Dusk. The only access and exit points at this time will be Richmond Gate
                on the Star and Garter roundabout where a gateman will be stationed.</p>

            <h4>Over night Parking</h4>
            <p>Cars can be left over night if they display a parking permit - freely available from Pembroke Lodge
                on the night.</p>

            <h4 id="taxi">Taxi Booking</h4>
            <p>We advise that taxis to be booked in advance prior to the date and that taxi companies <strong>MUST</strong>
                be informed that the only entrance to the park after dusk is via Richmond gate. Cars should drive up to
                the left hand gate and the gateman will let them in.</p>
